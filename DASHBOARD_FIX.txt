                    DASHBOARD FIX - ISSUE RESOLVED
================================================================================

🔧 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The console error showed: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'API_BASE' has 
already been declared"

This was causing the management pages to not load properly.

================================================================================
                    WHAT WAS FIXED
================================================================================

1. API_BASE Redeclaration Error:
   - Multiple scripts were declaring `const API_BASE = '/api'`
   - Changed to: `if (typeof API_BASE === 'undefined') { var API_BASE = '/api'; }`
   - Now checks if it exists before declaring

2. Function Loading Order:
   - Functions are now properly declared before being called
   - Global assignments moved to end of file
   - Proper hoisting ensured

3. Files Updated:
   - js/dashboard-content.js
   - js/admin-packages.js
